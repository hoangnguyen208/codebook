# Coding Standards

## C# and .NET Usage
- Use C# 10+ features when appropriate (e.g., record types, pattern matching, null-coalescing assignment).
- Leverage built-in ASP.NET Core features and middleware.
- Use Entity Framework Core effectively for database operations.
- Write concise, idiomatic C# code with accurate examples.
- Follow .NET and ASP.NET Core conventions and best practices.
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate.
- Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for collection operations.
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., 'IsUserSignedIn', 'CalculateTotal').
- Structure files according to .NET conventions (Controllers, Models, Services, etc.).
- Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and public members.
- Use camelCase for local variables and private fields.
- Use UPPERCASE for constants.
- Prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., 'IUserService').
- Follow the C# Coding Conventions (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use C#'s expressive syntax (e.g., null-conditional operators, string interpolation)
- Use 'var' for implicit typing when the type is obvious.
- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow.
- Implement proper error logging using built-in .NET logging or a third-party logger.
- Use Data Annotations or Fluent Validation for model validation.
- Implement global exception handling middleware.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and consistent error responses.
- Follow RESTful API design principles.
- Use attribute routing in controllers.
- Use action filters for cross-cutting concerns.
- Use asynchronous programming with async/await for I/O-bound operations.
- Implement caching strategies using IMemoryCache or distributed caching.
- Use efficient LINQ queries and avoid N+1 query problems.
- Implement pagination for large data sets.
- Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling and testability.
- Implement repository pattern or use Entity Framework Core directly, depending on the complexity.
- Don't use AutoMapper for object-to-object mapping, manually mapping necessary fields by creating extension methods such as entity.ToDto() or dto.ToEntity().
- Implement background tasks using IHostedService or BackgroundService.
- Write unit tests using xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest.
- Use Moq or NSubstitute for mocking dependencies.
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
- Use Authentication and Authorization middleware.
- Implement JWT authentication for stateless API authentication.
- Don't use HTTPS/SSL in development phase, only enable it until the final stage of deployment.
- Implement proper CORS policies.
- Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation (as per installed Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package).
- Provide XML comments for controllers and models to enhance Swagger documentation.

## TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types - use proper typing or `unknown`
- Define interfaces for all props, API responses, and data models
- Use type inference where obvious, explicit types where helpful

## React

- Functional components only (no class components)
- Use hooks for state and side effects
- Keep components focused - one job per component
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## Next.js

- Server components by default
- Only use `'use client'` when needed (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Use Server Actions for form submissions and simple mutations
- Use API routes when you need:
  - Webhooks (Stripe, GitHub, etc.)
  - File uploads with progress tracking
  - Long-running operations
  - Specific HTTP status codes or headers
  - Endpoints for future mobile/CLI clients
  - Third-party integrations
- Otherwise, fetch data directly in server components
- Dynamic routes for item/collection pages

## Tailwind CSS v4

**CRITICAL**: We are using Tailwind CSS v4, which uses CSS-based configuration.

- **DO NOT** create `tailwind.config.ts` or `tailwind.config.js` files (those are for v3)
- All theme configuration must be done in CSS using the `@theme` directive in `src/app/globals.css`
- Use CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, etc.
- No JavaScript-based config allowed

Example v4 configuration:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-primary: oklch(50% 0.2 250);
}

## File Organization

- Components: `src/components/[feature]/ComponentName.tsx`
- Pages: `src/app/[route]/page.tsx`
- Server Actions: `src/actions/[feature].ts`
- Types: `src/types/[feature].ts`
- Lib/Utils: `src/lib/[utility].ts`

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase (`ItemCard.tsx`)
- Files: Match component name or kebab-case
- Functions: camelCase
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (no prefix)

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Use shadcn/ui components where applicable
- No inline styles
- Dark mode first, light mode as option

## Database

- Use Entity Framework for database operations
- Handle missing migrations as well as updating migrations for schema changes gracefully
- Check status of migrations before committing to verify migrations are in sync
- Production deployments must always check migrations status before the app starts

## Data Fetching

- NextJS Server components fetch data from .NET API
- Client components use Server Actions
- Validate all inputs with Zod

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch in Server Actions
- Return `{ success, data, error }` pattern from actions
- Display user-friendly error messages via toast

## Code Quality

- No commented-out code unless specified
- No unused imports or variables
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
```
